Shown above are the Module and the Challenge District Comparison. If you notice, we keep the number of students the same, but we have updated the values in the other columns. This is due to the fact we drop the 9th Grade Class from Thomas High School for some of the columns that include finding the averages. When comparing the Module anbd Challange items, the averages for the passing grades have been decreased to account for the subtraction of the 9th grade class. It did not materially impact the data.

Shown above is the school spending between the module with the not clean data and the clean data found in the challenge. When reviewing the data, it shows that there truly is no correlation between the spending and the overall grade.

# Summary:
After reviewing the data betweent the clean data(challenge) and the module data, I do not believe a material impact was made. The averages for math and reading were slightly lower and the overall passing percentage for THS changed less than a percent.
